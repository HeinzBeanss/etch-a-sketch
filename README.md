# etch-a-sketch
A simply drawing mechanic on a webpage.


-- After completion -- 
It was fairly easy after I googled everything I needed to, it did bring up somethings I wasn't sure about but I'm sure I'll tackle those sooner rather than later. 
Such things include why functions used in button events automatically activate as soon as the document loads if they have brackets at the end. Also I should practice how to incorporate values into functions depending on the value given, perhaps I need to use parameters in functions to do this and if so I need to look into them more. 

Overall I have completed the task alongside some of the additional options. It's a minimal design so it's hard for it to look bad, but it doesn't exactly look good either, that being said visuals weren't exactly priority when creating this web page. I could have added a HTML colour picker as an option as well and I don't think it would have been too difficult but it's something I can explore at a later date. An issue I had was that the code was extremely messy, because of the things I don't necessarily understand I made my code longer than it needed to be.

At the end of the day, it works and functions properly, however, I know that the code could be written more concisely and in a cleaner fashion, but function over form so it's something I'll work on as I generally get more accustomed to writing code.
